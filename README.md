# Shapes Database
Working code for ECE244 Lab 4 (Fall 2022). The goal is to create and properly use 4 manual singly linkedlist classes: GroupList, GroupNode, ShapeList and ShapeNode. This project includes dynamic memory management (garbage collection) and has basic error checking. See the lab handout for more information.

# Shapes Database
Working code for ECE244 Lab 4 (Fall 2022). The goal is to create and properly use 4 manual singly linkedlist classes, GroupList, GroupNode, ShapeList and ShapeNode to manage a shapes databse. The application support the creation of shapes and groups, moving shapes between groups, deleting shapes and groups, and drawing information about the database to the console window. This project includes dynamic memory management (garbage collection) and has basic error checking. See the lab handout for more information.
